      <b>Ingredients</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Chicken: 1 lb (approx. 500g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs (best for juiciness) or breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>Oil: 1 to 2 tbsp olive oil or avocado oil</li>
        <li>Aromatics: 1 large yellow onion (finely diced), 2 cloves garlic (minced), 1 tbsp fresh ginger (minced)</li>
        <li>Spices: 1 tbsp curry powder (mild or hot), 1 tsp ground cumin, 1 tsp ground turmeric, 1/2 tsp garam masala (plus 1/2 tsp for finishing), 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)</li>
        <li>Base: 14 oz (400g) can diced tomatoes (fire-roasted recommended), 1 can (13.5 oz / 400ml) full-fat coconut milk</li>
        <li>Seasoning & Garnish: 1/2 tsp sea salt (or to taste), 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1/4 cup fresh cilantro (chopped), 1 tsp lemon juice or vinegar </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Sauté Aromatics: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the diced onions, garlic, and ginger. Cook for 4-5 minutes until the onions are soft and translucent.</li>
        <li>Bloom Spices: Add the curry powder, cumin, turmeric, 1/2 tsp of the garam masala, and cayenne pepper (if using). Stir constantly for 30-60 seconds to toast the spices and release their aroma.</li>
        <li>Build Sauce: Pour in the canned diced tomatoes and coconut milk. Stir to combine and bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat</li>
        <li>Cook Chicken: Add the cubed chicken pieces to the skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Finish and Serve: Stir in the remaining 1/2 tsp of garam masala and season with salt and pepper to taste. Top with fresh cilantro and a squeeze of lemon juice. Serve hot with basmati rice or naan. </li>
